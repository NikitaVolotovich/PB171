1) STM32F030F4:
VDD: 3.3 V,
Output pin; PA0.
2) AMS1117 regulator for stabilize voltage from 5V to 3.3V 
3) LED SMD 0402 body, 3.3V
I = 20 mA
R = (U - Uled) / I = (3.3 - 0.6(falling)) / 0.020 = 135 Om

I think I can use voltage divider for divide input voltage.
Max input voltage 12 V divide to 3.3 V and using ADC I can calculate input voltage.
Or not ?
Vout = (Vin * R2) / (R1 + R2)
Vin = 12V , R1 = 1000, Vout = 3.3V, R2 = 380
If (Vin == 12V) => ADC = 4095.

Servo motor datasheet: https://github.com/microrobotics/DS3235-270/blob/master/DS3235-270_datasheet.pdf
2S Li-on battery parallel = 7.4V.
Only 6 servo motors controlled by PWM is possible to connect to STM32F030F4 because only 6 PWM pins exists on this version MCU.

I use N MOSFET for PWM control DC motor SI2308DS. https://www.vishay.com/docs/70797/70797.pdf
When using MOSFET it’s necessary to use did, because the inductive surge from the motor will kill the transistor soon.

# 12
For both directions I use simple modern chip TA6586: https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/1809091025_RZ-Wuxi-Smart-Microelectronics-TA6586_C128851.pdf
I works in voltage 3-14 V and max current 7A.

# 13
Oh, I almost done it in ‘9’ o_O
3S battery was added, so it should work :)
